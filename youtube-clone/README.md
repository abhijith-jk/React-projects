If you wish to test this project out on your local machine, you may download the zip file and subscribe to Youtube V3 API on RapidAPI and use your key in .env file.

I would suggest referring Material UI documentation for more information about the styles and props used in this project.

PS : The project isn't entirely bug-free, but it was a great lesson to learn about API interactions and component based development using React Js.
