If you wish to test this project out on your local machine, you may download the zip file and subscribe to Shazam Core API on RapidAPI and use your key in  the .env file. You also have the choice of following the tutorial which I used to make this project. Enjoy Learning X)

Tutorial is linked below and you'll find the source code in the video description.

I would also highly recommend you understand Shazam Core API documentation : https://rapidapi.com/tipsters/api/shazam-core

PS : The project isn't entirely bug-free, but it was a great lesson to learn about API interactions and component based development using React Js.
